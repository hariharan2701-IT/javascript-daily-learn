/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Define a cube function that cubes
 *    any number passed in as an argument.
 *
 * 2) Call your cube function four times
 *    with different arguments to test it.
 *
 * Math.sqrt is a built-in function to find
 * the square root of a number.
 * e.g. Math.sqrt(9) finds the square root of 9.
 *
 * 3) Define and test a squareRoot function
 *    to find square roots and display
 *    them on the console.
 *    e.g. The square root of 9 is 3.
